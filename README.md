# JavaScript-Code-Quiz
## Description
 This project was made to create a fun quiz that people could use to test themselves in terms of their JavaScript knowledge. This project features a Home page that has a paragraph that introduces what this quiz is and how to play it. This Home page also has a start button that starts the quiz and the timer in the top right. Once the start button happens the questions pop up, of which the user can answer with the four answers provided. At the end, in the Results page, the score is given and there is an opportunity for the user to enter his or her intials. This then logs the record to the high scores page. This project helped me get really familiar with JavaScripts methods and made me a lot more comfortable with local storage. I also learned about how important the naming convention were. I feel my eyes are a lot more open to the variety of function "ids" and "classes" provide.
